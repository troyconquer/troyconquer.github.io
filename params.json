{"name":"Engager","tagline":"Heroku CX, Customer Rewards App ","body":"##Brief \r\n####“Engager” is a customer success application with one click deployment on Heroku. \r\n\r\nCustomer success is an art that requires constant customer engagement. This engagement is usually done through static tools like surveys that don’t reflect the dynamic nature of your business. With the Heroku powered app “Engager” you can create incentives that reflect the information you need right now. \r\n\r\nImagine a Dreamforce is forthcoming and you want to know which customers plan on attending. Within the app you could adjust the point value of the success question, “Do you plan to attend Dreamforce?” \r\n\r\nThe system then would alert all customers that an engagement question has an increased point value incentivizing the customer to log in and supply the answer.\r\n\r\nEngager uses Heroku connect to get your customer success data into your Salesforce instance where you can build dashboards and reports to take action on your findings. \r\n\r\nNow customer success data can be used to empower sales, marketing, support, and finance in ways that seemed impossible before.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Technical Brief\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/gonimbly/engager-api/tree/master) *Engager API*\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/gonimbly/engager-ui/tree/master) *Engager UI*\r\n\r\nBuilt on Heroku with Nodejs and React/HTML/CSS, deliver value to your customer and your organization simultaneously.
